        I'm the Front-End Developer and I would like to make something special for you.
        </p><p>
        I believe that it is possible to do everything just it is a must to put effort, 
        be flexible and not to be afraid sometimes to make mistake and learn from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy travelling and catching new ideas during my travels, so I would always 
            put fresh ideas in my work and that there would be no repeating stuff.
        </p>
